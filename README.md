this is a test
go on watch my youtube, check out my roblox and find my accounts with the same username all over the place cuz this is what happens after you commit yourself to a single name
also my google play, xbox and discords usernames are different for various reasons, primarily because they appeared long before griga ever was (russian club penguin knockoff included)
i have ps3 (x2 phat, one dead one not) and a nintendo switch and a steam deck and a lenovo g570 and a vaio vpcsa and an acer swift 3 (i think??) and a galaxy s22 ultra and a galaxy s21+ and a galaxy note 9 and a yandex station midi (black) and a yamaha arius piano and an hp laserjet pro m15a printer and a pc and a harman kardon aura 2 speaker and logi z407 speakers and galaxy buds+, a knock-off dualshock 3, an original sixaxis controller and even more stuff in my cabinet (i am in constant fear of trauma cuz this can all fall out on me when i open the doors)
